Spares matrix help is a package of scripts, programs, and libraries to analyze and process sparse matrices.

The intention is to have the ability to play around with sparse matrices. For example having different ordering schemes like GRMLCM a mixture of column and row major traversal.

This is and will likely always be experimental so expect things to break.
